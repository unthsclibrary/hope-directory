# hope-directory
This is beta version 1 of the HOPE Directory which is still undergoing testing before its official release. The HOPE Directory, short for health organizations, programs and events, offers a centralized source for reliable and authoritative local health information. The goal is to improve public health by removing barriers to access. The first year of this project will focus on the collection of data in Tarrant County, Texas, followed by surrounding counties in successive years.
