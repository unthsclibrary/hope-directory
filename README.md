# HOPE Directory
The HOPE Directory website was launched in February 2019 and moved out of beta in July 2019. The HOPE Directory, short for health organizations, programs and events, offers a centralized source for reliable and authoritative local health information. The goal is to improve public health by removing barriers to access. The first year of this project will focus on the collection of data in Tarrant County, Texas, followed by surrounding counties in successive years.
